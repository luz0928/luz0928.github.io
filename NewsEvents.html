                                                projects that have to do with Intelligent Mobility. The main task has been assisting in project
                                                management related to a project that was being deployed. I created technical notes, reports, and
                                                SOPs in a timely manner for various projects. I also assisted in the creation and execution of

                                    when completing a home rehabilitation programme. The discussion afterwards was very enriching
                                    and I'm glad to see that it is interesting to people outside my field!

                                    in the Advanced Digital Technologies Workshop. We got to know the amazing research that is being done in i2CAT.

                                    We were able to tour some labs and learn how the research ecosystem works. We visited ICFO for an overview on Quantum research,
                                    then to the PMT Mediterranean Science and Technology Park, and there we even had the chance to see the Drone lab!</p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">We also went to DFactory Barcelona to see their robotics and IoT labs,
                                    and the work they do with different 3D printing technologies. This was followed by talks related
                                    to different research lines in i2CAT, including Immersive and interactive technologies.

                                    On the fourth day we visited Eurecat and saw the great impact their projects have had in the country.
                                    Later that day, we also toured and learned about the research done in Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.</p>

                                    where 12 female and non-binary scientists talked about science in the open space of South King Street in Dublin City Centre.
                                It was great to collaborate with brilliant scientists in such a variety of topics!</p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">Even though it was a busy Saturday morning for people in the city, a lot of them stopped to hear us talk about how science is fun and can make a difference.
                                    I decided to talk about logic gates, to show people that learning engineering it's not so difficult if you start small.</p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">From March 13th to 17th 2023, I participated in the Social XR Spring School. <br><br>
                                    The program included topics such as the capturing and modelling of realistic avatars and their behavior,
                                    coding and transmission techniques of volumetric video content, ethics for the design and development of responsible
                                    social XR experiences, novel rending and interaction paradigms, and human factors and evaluation of experiences.
                                    Together, they provided a holistic perspective, helping participants to better understand the area and to initiate
                                    a network of collaboration to overcome current limitations of current real-time conferencing systems. </p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">Attending to this Spring School was such a great experience! Getting to meet so many people
                                    doing interesting research was so valuable to me. There were topics that I hadn't even thought about!
                                    but all important to develop this field of XR into things that actually matter.

                                    Thank you so much to the DIS group at the CWI for the lectures and hospitality, also for showing us a little bit of Amsterdam in the process.
                                    I think I can speak for all the attendees that we enjoyed every bit of it!</p>
